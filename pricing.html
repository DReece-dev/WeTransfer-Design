              You’ll be able to get started with WeTransfer Pro or WeTransfer Premium as soon as you’ve completed your
              payment. We’ll also send you a confirmation email with your paid invoice attached.
            </p>
            <p>
              Once you’re in, you’ll be able to send bigger transfers, start using portals, and create your very own
              WeTransfer page right away. If you have any previous transfers that were sent while you were on the free
              plan, you’ll also be able to change the expiration dates to whenever you like.

              When you use WeTransfer, anyone can download your files—there’s no need for them to log in or sign up.
              They’ll have to accept our Terms of Service and we may ask them to accept cookies, but that’s it!

            </p>
            <p>
              If you want to share work or collaborate in portals (WeTransfer’s latest feature), your clients and
              collaborators won’t need to sign up to view and select files, add comments, give approval, or download
              files. You’ll only need to add team members to your Pro or Premium plan if you want people to be able to
              add reviews and create portals with you.

              With a Pro or Premium plan, you can create your own WeTransfer page where anyone can send you files with
              the transfer size limit of your plan. That means you can get the large files you need from clients or
              collaborators, and they won’t need to have an account—just the URL to your page. (Though we may ask them
              to verify their email address to protect you from “foreign princes” who “want to send you money”).

          <div class="collapse-content">
            <p class="mb-3">
              First, you’ll need to sign up for WeTransfer Pro or WeTransfer Premium—you can’t add team members while
              you’re on the free plan. And whichever plan you choose, your team members will enjoy all the same benefits
              (so you can’t get Premium for yourself and have some team members on Pro, for example). Team members will
              be able to send and receive bigger transfers from your WeTransfer page, and manage transfers from one
              shared overview.
            </p>
            <p>
              Once you’ve signed up for the plan that’s best for your team, you’ll be able to invite as many team
              members as you like from your team management settings. You can add and remove members from your team at
              any time while your subscription is active.

              We accept PayPal as well as credit cards by major networks such as Visa, Mastercard, and American Express.
              We also support other online payment systems in some countries.
            </p>
            <p>
              We don’t accept direct bank transfers because you have to sign up for a recurring yearly or monthly
              subscription. (We’ll email you before this happens for the first time, to give you a heads up.)

              If you don’t have the unlimited storage with WeTransfer Premium, you’ll have to either clear up some
              storage space by deleting some of your sent transfers or upgrade your plan. Until you do, you won’t be
              able to send new transfers.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you’re using WeTransfer for free, all your transfers of up to 2 GB are automatically deleted after 7
              days. So don’t worry, it’s not possible for you to go over your storage limit.

            <p>
              To switch to using WeTransfer for free, all you need to do is go to your Account settings and cancel your
              subscription. You (and any team members you might have) will be able to continue using your Pro or Premium
              plan until the end of your current subscription period.

              To keep your ideas safe from attack or exploitation, your files are encrypted when they are transferred

              unique links sent to the sender and recipient.
